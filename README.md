Purpose for this  program was to create a useful applicaiton which would scrape the price of certain item I searched in amazon. The application would keep running to check the prize of the item and when the price would drop under a specified threshold, the program would send me an email with the URL to the amzon web page. A useful application to manage and help get the best price of the amazon item.

Key Concepts I used in this program was learnign to parse the html file using requests and beautiful soup library. This allowed me to understand the bridge between HTML and Python. Another concept I learned was the smtplib library which enabled me to configure and set up and email system to myself.
